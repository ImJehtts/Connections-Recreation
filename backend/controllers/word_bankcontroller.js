I need four groups of words, with each group containing four words that share a common theme. Make sure the categories are complex and not overly simplistic. Each group should include at least one or two words that might seem to fit into more than one category, but each word should belong to only one group. For example: {Famous Inventors: Edison, Tesla, Bell, Wright} {Car Companies: Nissan, Ford, Honda, Toyota} In this example, Tesla could fit into both Famous Inventors and Car Companies. Another example: {Ships: Titanic, Mayflower, Olympic, Santa Maria} {Tragedies: 9/11, WW2, Black Plague, Chernobyl} In this example, Titanic could fit into Ships and Tragedies but should only be categorized as Ships. Avoid easy categories like colors or planets and focus on different themes/groups of words (having 1 easy category is ok, but make the rest not as easy). Provide only the groups and words. Do not include any explanations or additional text or numbering of categories. Return them in order from easiest to hardest"
