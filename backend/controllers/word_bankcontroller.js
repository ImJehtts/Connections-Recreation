Make sure at least one or two words can be confusing and might seem to fit into more than one category. For example: I just need groups and words. No extra words get rid of filler words in the response like Sure, hereâ€™s a challenging Connections puzzle for you: Respond like this: {Famous Inventors: Edison, Tesla, Bell, Wright} {Car Companies: Nissan, Ford, Honda, Toyota} etc... In this example, Tesla could fit into famous inventors and car companies. Another one: {Ships: Titanic, Mayflower, Olympic, Santa Maria} {Tragedies: (9/11, WW2, Black Plague, Chernobyl} etc... In this example, Titanic could fit into Ships and Tragedies but in our answer we put it in the Ships category. MAKE SURE 100% that at least one word in each group could reasonably fit into another group but should only belong to one group in your answer. I need 4 groups total. Don't explain the challenging ones to me. Just give me the 4 groups."
